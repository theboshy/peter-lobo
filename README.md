<h1>This is my personal portfolio: </h1>

Implements github pages to deploy my portfloi built in react with typescript.

You can see the progress here [Â¡peter-lobo!](https://theboshy.github.io/peter-lobo/)


Also have some **circleci** *tests* and *integrations* (just some test, this repo needs to be private to complete all circleci configurations so stills in failed status)
