This is my personal portfolio: 

Implements github pages to deploy my portfloi built in react with typescript.
You can see the progress here [!peter-lobo](https://theboshy.github.io/peter-lobo/)


Also have some circleci test and integrations (just some test, this repo needs to be private to complete all circleci configurations so stills in failed status)
